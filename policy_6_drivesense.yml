  segment_text: Arity is a global technology company focused on making transportation
    smarter, safer, and more useful for everyone. Arity transforms large amounts of
    data into actionable insights to help better predict risk and make smarter decisions
    in real time. Arity provides services directly to consumers and indirectly through
    companies such as mobile application providers and insurance companies to capture
    and understand driving behavior. Arity also provides some products, such as its
    marketing solutions products, only to business customers, referred to as business
    clients, for their internal purposes, unrelated to their consumer products or
    services. Arity designs its products and services with privacy and data protection
    in mind.

  segment_text: Arity works with many different business clients such as mobile application
    providers, fleet management and sharing economy companies, vehicle manufacturers,

    collects information directly from consumers and sometimes the business client
    collects the information and shares that information with Arity. Arity also sometimes
    acts as a service provider to the business clients and when it does so Aritys
    use of personal information is subject to the business clients privacy policies.
