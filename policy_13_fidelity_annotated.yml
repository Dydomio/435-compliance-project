  segment_text: As you may know, your broker-dealer and National Financial Services
    LLC ("NFS") have an agreement through which NFS provides clearing and other related
    services for your account. In connection with these services, NFS is required
    to communicate its practices regarding the privacy of customer information. These
    practices also apply to you if you have a retirement account through your broker
    dealer for which Fidelity Management Trust Company (FMTC), an affiliate of NFS,
    is the custodian. Additionally, if your broker-dealer offers managed account services
    through the Fidelity Managed Account XchangeSM, a managed account platform sponsored
    by Fidelity Institutional Wealth Adviser LLC ("FIWA"), a registered investment
    advisor affiliate of NFS, FIWA will follow these privacy practices as well. You
    do not have to contact your broker-dealer to benefit from these protections; they
    apply automatically to all customers. We review our privacy policy annually. Our
    printed and online notices are then updated to reflect any changes. In this policy,
    personal information means information about an individual that is collected or
    maintained for business purposes and by which the individual can be identified.
