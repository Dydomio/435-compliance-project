  sentence_annotations: []
- segment_id: 62
  segment_text: If you choose to use the Contacts Sync feature of Duolingo you must
    first give your device permission to allow the Duolingo app access to the contacts
    stored on your device. The app then requires you to provide your phone number.
    This is so that Duolingo can verify that this number does belong to you. Once
    you provide your number, a text message is sent to you containing a one time password
    (OTP) six digit code. You can choose to let the app read your verification text
    message or you can input it manually to verify your number. This phone number
    is stored in your Duolingo user profile.
  sentence_annotations: []
- segment_id: 63
  segment_text: With your permission, we upload your list of contact phone numbers
    and using encryption we store a hashed version of the contact phone numbers. This
    hash is an alternative code to the actual phone number and can be used only by
    Duolingo to uniquely identify the number. Its a bit like a fingerprint. This hashing
    process securely strips away the real phone number which means that we dont store
    any of your contacts phone numbers and so we cannot use them to contact individuals
    or share them with anyone else.
  sentence_annotations: []
- segment_id: 64
  segment_text: We then try to match your contacts hashes with the hashed phone numbers
    that other Duolingo learners have chosen to upload to use using the Contacts Sync
    feature. If we find a match we will recommend that learner as someone you may
    wish to follow.
  sentence_annotations: []

  segment_text: If you turn off the Contacts Sync feature, the hashed contacts you
    have chosen to upload, along with your hashed phone number are automatically deleted
