Shazam & Privacy
Shazam is designed to protect your information and enable you to choose what you share.
We built this page to answer the questions you may have regarding your Shazam dataâ€”and show you how to easily manage your data.
What data do we collect and how do we use it?
Shazam collects information about you when you interact with our sites or apps. Whether your Shazam data is associated with you depends on whether you use Shazam with an account. If you use Shazam with an account, your Shazam data will be associated with your account credentials (for example, your email address or Apple ID).

If you create a Shazam account using a third-party service, we may receive some information about you from that network (for example, your Google ID).
Information about the songs you identify using Shazam, to display the list of your discoveries and to provide you with recommended music in various pages within the Shazam app.
Information about your activity in Shazam to improve the app, such as the pages you view and buttons you select, device information such as make and model, operating system version, and IP address. We may also use this information to detect fraud or misuse of the service and may approximate your location to offer Shazam charts of trending songs.
You may choose to provide Shazam with permission to collect your location while you are using the app. We use location data to show you where your songs are Shazamed and improve the quality of the service.
If you turn on Notifications for Shazam, we may send you push notifications that are personalized based on your Shazam activity.
