  segment_text: This Policy describes how we obtain and use personal data (which can
    be used to identify a specific individual) and anonymous data (which cant) about
    our users. Certain parts of the Policy, which are clearly labeled, apply only
    to some users (e.g., those in the EU or California, those who are accessing the
    Services under a plan paid for by their employer). We may change this Policy at
    any time by posting the revised Policy here. We will notify current users of major
    changes through email, in-app notifications, or otherwise. While we need certain
    Personal Data to provide the Services, we try to collect only what we need. We

    of a Family Plan) when requested.

    Data for money or any other consideration (e.g., trade it for free services).
    However, the CCPAs broad definition of sale may include situations where conversion
    data is sent to referral advertisers (when you click on an ad that sends you to
    Dashlane, we send a unique identifier to the referring site so they can receive
    credit for the referral). While the information we send does not include any Personal
    Data, the fact that you clicked on a link and visited Dashlane may be added to
    your profile by the ad publisher. This is all done on the Site with Publisher
    Cookies (as defined in our Cookie Policy) and opting out of the sale of your Personal
    Data will turn these cookies off.

    through cookies (such as the region you are accessing the Apps from), and from

    Data we collect includes your email and (for Subscriptions) billing information,

    Because of our zero-knowledge architecture, we do not and cannot know what information

    authentication) and / or an additional email (for example, if you lose access
    to the email used to login to your Account). The only Personal Data required to
    open a Dashlane Free account is your email. We store registration data until seven
    (7) days after you delete your Account. For paid Accounts, users must provide
    billing data as specified below. For Dashlane Business or Dashlane Teams Accounts,
    registration data includes the business name, mailing address (if paying by invoice),
    and administrator contact information. It is critical to keep registration data
    current. We must be able to verify that you are the Account owner to respond to
    certain customer service requests. If you lose access to the contact email or
    phone number associated with your Account (if applicable), you may be locked out
    of your Account, and we may be unable to help you.

    that use single sign-on (SSO) to access the Services, each user must create a
    Master Password, which is used to access their Account and generate the encryption
    keys that secure the information they store in the Apps (Secured Data as further
    defined below). The more secure a Master Password is, the safer Secured Data will
    be. Dashlanes zero-knowledge architecture ensures that we do not and cannot know
    our users Master Passwords or the data used to generate SSO encryption keys, so
    we cannot access Secured Data. There is no backdoor or master key; even if a hacker
    somehow obtained all the Secured Data on our servers, they would have to hack
    each user separately. Apps do not store Master Passwords locally unless specifically
    directed by the user. If you direct an App to retain your Master Password and
    your device is stolen or compromised, your Secured Data may be exposed.
