    authentication) and / or an additional email (for example, if you lose access

    (7) days after you delete your Account. For paid Accounts, users must provide
    billing data as specified below. For Dashlane Business or Dashlane Teams Accounts,
    registration data includes the business name, mailing address (if paying by invoice),
    and administrator contact information. It is critical to keep registration data
    current. We must be able to verify that you are the Account owner to respond to
    certain customer service requests. If you lose access to the contact email or

    that use single sign-on (SSO) to access the Services, each user must create a
    Master Password, which is used to access their Account and generate the encryption
    keys that secure the information they store in the Apps (Secured Data as further
    defined below). The more secure a Master Password is, the safer Secured Data will
    be. Dashlanes zero-knowledge architecture ensures that we do not and cannot know
    our users Master Passwords or the data used to generate SSO encryption keys, so
    we cannot access Secured Data. There is no backdoor or master key; even if a hacker
    somehow obtained all the Secured Data on our servers, they would have to hack
    each user separately. Apps do not store Master Passwords locally unless specifically
    directed by the user. If you direct an App to retain your Master Password and
    your device is stolen or compromised, your Secured Data may be exposed.
