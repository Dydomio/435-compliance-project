  segment_text: Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and
    Chrome) have a Do Not Track (DNT) feature that tells a website that a user does
    not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds
    to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from
    collecting certain information about the browsers user. Not all browsers offer
    a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses,
    including Tinder, do not currently respond to DNT signals.
