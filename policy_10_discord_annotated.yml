    are telling us to share that content with certain communities, people, or in the
    case of public spaces, with anyone who accesses it. Who can access that information
    is determined by who can access a particular community. Server owners or admins
    set those permissions, and they control whether a server requires an invite link
    or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the
    server, may change over time. Similarly, if you link your Discord account with
    a third-party service (like a music-streaming service) or participate in a server
    that has third-party features like bots enabled, you may be telling us to share
