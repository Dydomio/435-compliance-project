    is important to us, we will ask you to verify your identity or provide additional
    information before we let you access or update your personal information. We may
    also reject your request to access or update your personal information for a number
    of reasons, including, for example, if the request risks the privacy of other
    users or is unlawful.

    all Snapchatters, and whether youd like to block another Snapchatter from contacting
    you again. Go here to learn more.
